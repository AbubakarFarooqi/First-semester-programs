        <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b>
        is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been<br>the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of <br>type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but<br>also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <br>1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently <br>with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
